== Description ==

This add on for Property Hive adds the ability to request feedback on a property from an applicant after a viewing

== Installation ==

= Special Requirements =

If wanting to output the Viewing Feedback Request in PDF format you will need the wkhtmltopdf package installed on the server. We recommend you speak to your server providers about getting this setup. Note that on shared servers this might not always be possible.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the Property Hive Viewing Feedback Request Add-on plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

Once installed and activated, you can access the settings for this add on by navigating to 'PropertyHive > Settings > Viewing Feedback Request' from within Wordpress.

Updating should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
