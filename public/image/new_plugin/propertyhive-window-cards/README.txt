This add on for Property Hive adds the ability to print a window card for each property from within WordPress.

== Description ==

This add on for Property Hive adds the ability to print a window card for each property from within WordPress.

== Installation ==

= Special Requirements =

If wanting to output the window cards in PDF format you will need the wkhtmltopdf package installed on the server. We recommend you speak to your server providers about getting this setup. Note that on shared servers this might not always be possible.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the Property Hive Window Cards Add-on plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

Once installed and activated, you can access the settings for this add on by navigating to 'PropertyHive > Settings > Window Cards' from within Wordpress.

= Updating =

Updating should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
