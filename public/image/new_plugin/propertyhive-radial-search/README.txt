This add on for Property Hive allows users to perform radial searches based on their entered location.

== Description ==

This add on for Property Hive allows users to perform radial searches based on their entered location.

== Installation ==

= Special Requirements =

This add on requires the 'allow_url_fopen' PHP setting be enabled as it makes requests to a third party service to geocode locations entered to lat/lng co-ordinates.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the Property Hive Radial Search Add-on plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Updating should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
