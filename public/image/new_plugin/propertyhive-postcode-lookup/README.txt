This add on for Property Hive improves speed and accuracy when entering property addresses.

== Description ==

This add on for Property Hive improves speed and accuracy when entering properties. Search for the postcode and a list of addresses will be shown to you that you can select from. This ensures it's quicker to enter properties, and reduces the chance of user error and typos.

This add on relies on that fact that you have an account with a third party postcode lookup service. The services we currently support are Postcode Anywhere, getAddress(), Ideal Postcodes and Google Geocoding.

== Installation ==

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the Property Hive Postcode Lookup Add-on plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

Once installed and activated, you can access the settings for this add on by navigating to 'PropertyHive > Settings > Postcode Lookup' from within Wordpress.

= Updating =

Updating should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
